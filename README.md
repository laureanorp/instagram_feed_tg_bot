## Currently abandoned
### Meta's restrictions on its platforms are constantly breaking instaloader, the package this bot depends on. So for now I won't be continuing this experiment.

---------------------

You will need to export the following environment variables on your env for the bot to work
```
export TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your_telegram_token
export INSTA_USERNAME=your_insta_username
export INSTA_PASSWORD=your_insta_password
```

`pip install "python-telegram-bot[job-queue]"`
